Q1.How to define a class with properties and methods in JavaScript?

Ans. There are 2 method define a class . In Es6 there is class keyword to define class. In other hand javascript have prototype and propertty itself and 
we can defineproty by Object.defineProperties().

ex 1.  Class Test() {
...
}
let test1 = new Test(); // constructer create new object of type class test.
have aleready get and set metted

Ex2. function Person() {
    var _firstName = "unknown";

    Object.defineProperties(this, {
        "FirstName": {
            get: function () {
                return _firstName;
            },
            set: function (value) {
                _firstName = value;
            }
        }
    });
};

var person1 = new Person(); //by constructer property global
person1.FirstName = "Steve";
alert(person1.FirstName );

we can create getter and setter method by Object.defineProperties().
function Person() {
    var _firstName = "unknown";

    Object.defineProperties(this, {
        "FirstName": {
            get: function () {
                return _firstName;
            },
            set: function (value) {
                _firstName = value;
            }
        }
    });
};

var person1 = new Person();
person1.FirstName = "Steve";
alert(person1.FirstName );
            
var person2 = new Person();
person2.FirstName = "Bill";
alert(person2.FirstName );

Q2. How to implement class inheritance in JavaScript?
Ans. Inheritance enables you to define a class that takes all the functionality from a parent class and allows you to add more.

Using class inheritance, a class can inherit all the methods and properties of another class.

Inheritance is a useful feature that allows code reusability.

To use class inheritance, you use the extends keyword. For example,


// parent class
class Person { 
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
        this.occupation = "unemployed";
    }
    
    greet() {
        console.log(`Hello ${this.name}.`);
    }
 
}

// inheriting parent class
class Student extends Person {

    constructor(name) {
        
        // call the super class constructor and pass in the name parameter
        super(name);
        
        // Overriding an occupation property
        this.occupation = 'Student';
    }
    
    // overriding Person's method
    greet() {
        console.log(`Hello student ${this.name}.`);
        console.log('occupation: ' + this.occupation);
    }
}

let p = new Student('Jack');
p.greet();

Q. Explain the difference between Object.freeze() vs const?

Ans . const: The const keyword creates a read-only reference to a value. Variables created by the const keyword are immutable. 
In other words, you can’t reassign them to different values. Trying to reassign a constant variable will result in a TypeError.

Ex. const myName = "Geeksforgeeks"
console.log(myName)

// Uncaught TypeError
myName = "gfg" 

The const keyword ensures that the variable created is read-only. 
But It doesn’t mean that the actual value to which the const variable reference is immutable. 
Even though the person variable is constant. However, you can change the value of its property.
 But you cannot reassign a different value to the person constant.

 const person = {
    name: "Geeksforgeeks"
};
     
// No TypeError
person.name = "gfg";
console.log(person.name);


Object.freeze() method: If you want the value of the person object to be immutable, you have to freeze it by using the Object.freeze() method. 

const person = Object.freeze({name: "Geeksforgeeks"});
    
// TypeError in strict mode
//in non-strict mode it prints "Geeksforgeeks"
person.name = "gfg";

The Object.freeze() method is shallow, meaning that it can freeze the properties of the object, not the objects referenced by the properties. 

const person = Object.freeze({
    name: 'Geeksforgeeks',
    address: {
        city:"Noida"
    }
});
But the person.address object is not immutable, you can add a new property to the person.address object as follows: 
// No TypeError
person.address.country = "India";

Q. How to Sort a Number Array?

Ans. JavaSript provided sort mathed to sort the array.but it is sort as string so number sorting will not correct. Ex 75 and 200 is treated as "75" and "200"
    than “75” is bigger than “200”.

    so there are 2 way to sorting....

    Using Compare Function
    By Creating Loops

    Compare function  ---- 
    Using Compare Function: We can create a Compare function that return negative, zero, or positive values. 
    Syntax: 
 

    function(a, b){return a - b}
 

    Negative Value ( a > b) => a will be Place before b
    zero value (a == b) => No Change
    Positive Value (a < b ) => a will be place after b


    var marks = [12, 25, 31, 23, 75, 81, 100];
    // Sort elements using compare method
     marks.sort(function(a, b){return a - b}); // For assending order
     marks.sort(function(a, b){return b - a}); // for desending order

     Creating Loops: We can also use loops to sort the array elements. Here, 
     we will use bubble sort (simple sorting technique) to sort the array elements in ascending order.
 
     function Numeric_sort(ar) {
     
        var i = 0, j;
         
        while (i < ar.length) {
            j = i + 1;
            while (j < ar.length) {
                 
                if (ar[j] < ar[i]) {
                    var temp = ar[i];
                    ar[i] = ar[j];
                    ar[j] = temp;
                }
                j++;
            }
            i++;
        }
    }
     
    // Original Array
    var arr = [1, 15, 10, 45, 27, 100];
