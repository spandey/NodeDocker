A team has created the following package.json for their new Node.js web application:
{
  "name": "webapp",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index_main.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {Intersection
    "express": "^4.17.1",
    "random": "~2.1.8"
  }
}
What can be concluded about the project, considering only the package.json declaration?
(Select all acceptable answers.) 
1) The project could use the 4.18.1 version of the express dependency.

2) The project could use the 4.17.2 version of the express dependency.
3) The project could use the 2.1.9 version of the random dependency.
4) The project could use the 2.2.0 version of the random dependency.

5) Running "npm test" for this project will run a test suite. 

6) If this project is in node_modules, "require('webapp')" will return the object from the project's index.js file.
